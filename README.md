# Skill Gap Analysis Tool

![Skill Gap Analysis](https://media.publit.io/file/w_,,q_80/chrmpWebsite/skills-gap-analysis-2.png)

## Introduction

The Skill Gap Analysis Tool is designed to identify the gap between job requirements and the current skill set of a job seeker. By analyzing job descriptions and candidate profiles, this tool helps individuals understand what skills they need to acquire to meet the demands of their desired job roles.

## Features

- **Skill Extraction**: Extract required skills from job descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- **Profile Analysis**: Analyze candidate profiles to identify their current skills.
- **Gap Analysis**: Compare the skills required for desired jobs with the skills the candidate possesses.
- **Gap Report**: Generate a detailed report highlighting missing skills and suggest learning resources.
- **Trending Skills**: Display trending skills in the job market.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project, we aim to bridge the gap between job market demands and individual skill sets. The project involves several key steps, including data collection, processing, analysis, and reporting.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Extract and analyze skills required in various job postings.</li>
        <li>Compare the skills required by employers with the skills possessed by job seekers.</li>
        <li>Identify gaps in skills and provide recommendations for improvement.</li>
        <li>Visualize trends in skill demands over time and across different job roles.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Project Workflow</h2>
    <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
    <p>We start by collecting job postings and candidate profiles data. This data includes job titles, company names, required experience, job locations, job descriptions, and candidate skills.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Job Listings Data:</strong> Scraped from job portals, containing information about job requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Candidate Profiles Data:</strong> Contains details about the skills and experiences of job seekers.</li>
    </ul>

<h3> Data Processing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cleaning and Preprocessing:</strong> Handle missing values, normalize text data, and ensure consistent formatting.</li>
        <li><strong>Skill Extraction:</strong> Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract skills from job descriptions and candidate profiles.</li>
    </ul>

<h3> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Create visual representations of the data to identify patterns and insights.</li>
        <li><strong>Trend Analysis:</strong> Examine trends in job postings, such as the most in-demand skills, common job locations, and average experience required.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>4. Skill Gap Analysis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Profile Matching:</strong> Compare the skills listed in job descriptions with those in candidate profiles.</li>
        <li><strong>Gap Identification:</strong> Identify missing skills by analyzing the difference between required and possessed skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation Generation:</strong> Provide suggestions for skills to learn, based on the identified gaps.</li>
    </ul>

<h3> Reporting and Visualization</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gap Report:</strong> Generate detailed reports highlighting skill gaps and recommending learning resources.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Approach Taken</h2>
    <h3>Data Processing and Analysis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Text Preprocessing:</strong> Clean the text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing lemmatization.</li>
        <li><strong>Skill Extraction:</strong> Use NLP libraries like SpaCy or NLTK to extract relevant skills from job descriptions and candidate profiles.</li>
        <li><strong>Skill Matching:</strong> Compare the extracted skills from job postings with those from candidate profiles to identify gaps.</li>
        <li><strong>Trend Analysis:</strong> Use time series analysis to identify trends in skill demands over different periods.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Tool Development</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Processing Scripts:</strong> Develop scripts to clean and preprocess the data.</li>
        <li><strong>Skill Extraction Module:</strong> Implement a module to extract skills using NLP techniques.</li>
        <li><strong>Gap Analysis Module:</strong> Create a module to compare job requirements with candidate skills and identify gaps.</li>
        <li><strong>Dashboard:</strong> Build an interactive dashboard using tools like Dash or Streamlit to visualize the results.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>By the end of this project, we aim to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identify Skill Gaps:</strong> Clearly understand the skills that are most commonly missing in candidate profiles compared to job requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight In-Demand Skills:</strong> Identify which skills are trending and most sought after by employers.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide Actionable Insights:</strong> Offer job seekers clear and actionable recommendations on which skills to acquire or improve.</li>
        <li><strong>Assist Recruiters:</strong> Help recruiters understand the skill landscape and better match candidates to job roles.</li>
    </ul>
